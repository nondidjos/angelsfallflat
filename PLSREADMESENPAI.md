Hi, this is my prototype for now, if you want to run it, open the folder in visual studio code after downloading the love extension, then press alt + l

All of the intellectual proprety is Strangely Interactive's, I don't own right to the logos, weapons or ship designs appearing in this SOFTWARE PRODUCT. 

You are disallowed from selling this software because its covered by the GPL 3.0 license, take that.
(idk what im doing or if it even works this way but please ask before using this code or sprites in any way thx)
